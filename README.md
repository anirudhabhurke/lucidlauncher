# Lucid Launcher

Android Launcher app made in React Native

## How it works

Basically, the frontend is built upon React Native. Rest is use of "native modules" in React Native to fetch list of apps shown in launcher and launching the app using intent. Double tap anywhere to lock screen (except apps list) makes use of another app which makes use of another app that I made - "YLocker".

Note: I have hardcoded package names for apps in the dock to work with Google Phone, SMS Organizer, Solid Explorer and Settings apps only. These apps need to be installed.
